### Terms of Service: 

By using this bot, you acknowledge that:

- **Primary Purpose:** This bot was created *solely* for use on my personal Discord server. If you’re not me and somehow got it working in your own server—good luck, but that’s on you.

- **Unauthorized Use Liability:** If the bot functions outside my intended setup and causes any kind of chaos, glitches, heartbreak, or financial ruin, that’s your problem. You added it. I warned you. You chose chaos.

- **Data Collection & Privacy:** I have *zero clue* what data this bot collects, how it stores anything, or whether it’s hooked up to any sketchy third-party services. Proceed at your own digital peril.

- **Support & Maintenance:** This bot is not a priority. I have a life. I make zero guarantees about uptime, bug fixes, updates, or feature continuity.

- **Liability Waiver:** I am not responsible for anything this bot does—including, but not limited to, data loss, server implosion, or spontaneous sentience. You cannot sue me or revoke my Discord existence.

- **As-Is Usage:** This bot comes as it is. No warranty, no promises, no refunds.

- **Termination:** If you want to stop using it… I mean, figure it out. I'm not tech support.
