### Privacy Policy: 

By using this bot, you acknowledge the following:

- **Data Collection:** I don’t know what data this bot collects. Maybe it logs your messages. Maybe it sends them to a server in a cave powered by raccoons. The truth is… unclear.

- **Third-Party Services:** I might be unintentionally using third-party services. Could be Discord’s API, could be something else. I haven't read their terms either.

- **Data Storage:** No clue where data goes. Could be local, could be floating in a cloud somewhere. I didn’t architect the matrix.

- **Use of Data:** I’m not using your data for ads, research, or world domination. Mostly because I wouldn’t know how.

- **Data Security:** You’re trusting a bot whose creator said “figure it out” in the Terms. So, if you’re worried about hackers or leaks… maybe don’t use it?

- **Data Removal:** Want your data removed? There’s no button for that. Ping me, I guess. But again… no promises.

- **Children’s Privacy:** This bot wasn’t designed for kids. If you're under legal age in your country, maybe wait a bit before diving into the world of rogue bots.
